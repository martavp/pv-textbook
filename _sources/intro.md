# Welcome
Welcome to the website accompanying the book **Fundamentals of Solar Cells and Photovoltaic Systems Engineering** ([ebook version is available](https://books.google.dk/books/about/Fundamentals_of_Solar_Cells_and_Photovol.html?id=OCfqEAAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y) and the physical version will be available in September 2024).
The book and this repository are used in the [Solar Energy course](https://www.kursuskatalog.au.dk/da/course/122065/Solar-Energy) developed by [Assoc. Prof. Marta Victoria](https://martavictoria.org) and offered at [Aarhus University](https://international.au.dk/). Some of the materials are also used at the [Master Degree in Photovoltaic Solar Energy](https://www.ies.upm.es/Master?id=8dd8633480cdb610VgnVCM10000009c7648a____&prefmt=articulo&fmt=detail) taught at the [Solar Energy Institute](https://www.ies.upm.es/) of the Technical University of Madrid.

On this website, you will find [relevant links]() for different topics covered in every chapter of the book, as well as detailed solutions for some of the problems in the book. Python and packages such as `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, and `pvlib` are used to obtain the solution. The facilitate the starting process, practical introductions to those packages are also provided. 

The topics covered in the problems include:

- modeling solar radiation 
- calculating IV curves for different irradiance and temperature
- modelling electricity generation from distributed and utility-scale PV installations
- optimizing the orientation and inclination angles of PV modules for a specific location
- time series analysis of solar generation
